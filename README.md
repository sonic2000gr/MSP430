# MSP430
Examples of MSP430 Code in C and Assembly Language.

In order to use this code, create a suitable project for C or Assembly, choosing the right type of MCU as described in the file. The replace (or paste the contents) of the main.c / main.asm file with the files contained here.

There are examples for the Value Line  (MSP430G2553) and MSP430F5529 LaunchPads. These will probably run fine with little to no modifications in other MSP430 MCUs as well.
